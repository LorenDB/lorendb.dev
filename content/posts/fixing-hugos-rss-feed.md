I've built this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which I love for its sheer simplicity. However, I noticed that the autogenerated [RSS feed](./index.xml) wasn't showing
any author information. It turns out that I copy-pasted an outdated `hugo.toml` template that used an older method of specifying author information. This led to the following
changes in my `hugo.toml`:

``` toml
[params]
  # before
  author = "Loren Burkholder"
  
  # after
  author.name = "Loren Burkholder"
  author.link = "https://lorendb.dev"
  author.email = "computersemiexpert@outlook.com"
```

However, the feed still had some problems. The author for each post was formatted as `computersemiexpert@outlook.com (Loren Burkholder)`, which is pointlessly verbose. Furthermore,
while I try to add tags to each post I make, Hugo was blissfully ignoring them in the RSS feed.

The author name formatting was fairly easy to fix; I just needed to copy the [default RSS template](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/_default/rss.xml)
to `layouts/_default/rss.xml` and change the author field from this:

``` xml
{{- with $authorEmail }}<author>{{ . }}{{ with $authorName }} ({{ . }}){{ end }}</author>{{ end }}
```

to this:

``` xml
{{- with $authorName }}<author>{{ . }}</author>{{ end }}
```

This will render each post with the author set to `Loren Burkholder`. Much better!

The tags were slightly trickier. Since I'm a total Hugo scripting noob, I ended up copying a [general tag rendering snippet](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/loop-through-categories-tags/20317/2)
from the Hugo forums and adapting it to my RSS template:

``` xml
{{ if isset .Params "tags" -}}
    {{ range $index, $name := sort .Params.tags -}}
    <category>{{ $name }}</category>
    {{- end}}
{{- end }} 
```

You can find my entire RSS template [here](https://github.com/LorenDB/lorendb.dev/blob/master/layouts/_default/rss.xml) if you want to use it in your own Hugo site. Visitors
from the future may wish to check out this [permalink](https://github.com/LorenDB/lorendb.dev/blob/d757e70b762843f2efc45ee4d7c01a263b004d17/layouts/_default/rss.xml) in case
I completely redo my template and you need the original for some reason.
